# Cisco Secure Workload - Secure-X Workflows	

These workflows can be downloaded as JSON files, and imported into Cisco Secure-X orchestrator.

# After Importing...

 - Open the Workflow and click on the 'start' circle
 - On the right-hand side (you may need to scroll down) fill in the variables with your information (see picture below)
 - If you dont know your inventory filter id, simply open the CSW UI, and open that inventory filter. It will be the value in the URL after '?filter_id='
